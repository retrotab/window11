I have added Weather API and Facts API, that fetches data, for Weather Information to work on your taskbar  allow the location for this website to work! or it would prevent to default widget icon.
Currently works pretty well on desktop size systems.

I know these are not many features that will interest that much, so I will be adding more features and functionalities to it. Stay Tuned.
